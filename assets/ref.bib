    abstract = {The rise of the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) platform marks a promising pathway towards the realization of monolithic quantum photonic networks. However, the challenge of establishing room-temperature entangled registers on these integrated photonics platforms remains unresolved. Herein, we demonstrate the first entangled processor on the SiCOI platform.We show that both deterministic generation of single divacancy electron spins and near-unity spin initialization of a single 13C nuclear spin can be achieved on SiCOI at room temperature. Besides coherently manipulating the single nuclear spin, a maximally entangled state with a fidelity of 0.89 has been prepared on this CMOS-compatible semiconductor-integrated photonics system. This work establishes the foundation for compact and on-chip solutions within existing defect-based computing and sensing protocols, positioning the SiCOI platform as the mostpromising candidate for integrated monolithic quantum photonic networks.
    本研究探索了4H绝缘层碳化硅（SiCOI）平台在构建室温下可集成的量子光子网络方面的潜力。我们在SiCOI平台上构建了一个纠缠处理器，这是一个初步的尝试。研究表明，在室温条件下，该平台能够用于确定性生成单个双空位电子自旋，并实现对单个碳-13核自旋的初始化，初始化成功率接近100%。此外，研究还证明了在CMOS兼容的半导体集成光子系统中对单个核自旋进行相干操控的可行性。我们还制备了保真度为0.89的纠缠态。这一发现为基于量子缺陷的量子计算和传感器提供了一种可能的片上解决方案，并为SiCOI平台在量子光子学集成中的应用提供了实验依据。},

  abstract={Qubit initialization is a critical task in quantum computation and communication. Extensive efforts have been made to achieve this with high speed, efficiency and scalability. However, previous approaches have either been measurement based and required fast feedback, suffered from crosstalk or required sophisticated calibration. Here, we report a fast and high fidelity reset scheme, avoiding the issues above without any additional chip architecture. By modulating the flux through a transmon qubit, we realize a swap between the qubit and its readout resonator that suppresses the excited state population to 0.08% within 34 ns (284 ns if photon depletion of the resonator is required). Furthermore, our approach can achieve effective second excited state depletion,has negligible effects on neighboring qubits, and  offers a way to entangle the qubit with an itinerant single photon, useful in quantum communication applications.
  本研究聚焦于量子比特（qubit）的初始化问题，这是量子计算和通信中的核心技术挑战。传统方法往往依赖于基于测量的反馈过程，这在实施中可能会遇到如串扰和复杂校准等问题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的快速且高保真的量子比特重置方案。该方案通过调制transmon量子比特的通量，实现了与读出谐振器之间的高效能量交换，从而在34纳秒内将激发态的布居数降低到0.08%±0.08%。我们的方法优势包括：有效地耗尽第二激发态、对相邻量子位的最小干扰，以及为量子比特与微波单光子之间的纠缠提供可能，这对于量子通信有重要的潜在应用。},

  abstract={On-demand, single-photon emitters (SPEs) play a key role across a broad range of quantum technologies. In quantum networks and quantum key distribution protocols, where photons are used as flying qubits, telecom wavelength operation is preferred because of the reduced fiber loss. However, despite the tremendous efforts to develop various triggered SPE platforms, a robust source of triggered SPEs operating at room temperature and the telecom wavelength is still missing. We report a triggered, optically stable, room temperature solid-state SPE operating at telecom wavelengths. The emitters exhibit high photon purity (~5% multiphoton events) and a record-high brightness of ~1.5 MHz. The emission is attributed to localized defects in a gallium nitride (GaN) crystal. The high-performance SPEs embedded in a technologically mature semiconductor are promising for on-chip quantum simulators and practical quantum communication technologies.

  abstract={The ability to prepare, optically read out and coherently control single quantum states is a key requirement for quantum information processing. Optically active solid-state emitters have emerged as promising candidates with their prospects for on-chip integration as quantum nodes and sources of coherent photons connecting these nodes. Under a strongly driving resonant laser field, such quantum emitters can exhibit quantum behaviour such as Autler–Townes splitting and the Mollow triplet spectrum. Here we demonstrate coherent control of a strongly driven optical transition in silicon vacancy centre in diamond. Rapid optical detection of photons enabled the observation of time-resolved coherent Rabi oscillations and the Mollow triplet spectrum. Detection with a probing transition further confirmed Autler–Townes splitting generated by a strong laser field. The coherence time of the emitted photons is comparable to its lifetime and robust under a very strong driving field, which is promising for the generation of indistinguishable photons.

The robustness against environmental noise is a critical requirement for solid-state spin sensors. In this paper, we present a self-protected infrared high-sensitivity thermometry based on spin defects in silicon carbide. Based on the conclusion that the Ramsey oscillations of the spin sensor are robust against magnetic noise due to a self-protected mechanism from the intrinsic transverse strain of the defect, we experimentally demonstrate the Ramsey-based thermometry. The self-protected infrared silicon-carbide thermometry may provide a promising platform for high sensitivity and high-spatial-resolution temperature sensing in a practical noisy environment, especially in biological systems and microelectronics systems.

  abstract={Optical “blinking” normally refers to a switching behavior of fluorescence for quantum emissions between “ON” and “OFF” state. For quantum dots, single molecules, and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, it usually stems from conversions between two different charge states, with one emitting strong and bright fluorescence while the other scattering weak or no fluorescence. Here, a different type of blinking from single emitters in ion implanted diamond is reported, with both blinking states exhibiting detectable photoluminescence under nonresonant excitation. Thanks to the low jumping rates, the dynamics of the emission can be directly monitored. The quadratic power dependence of the conversion rates suggests the possibility of two-photon ionization process in quantum jumps. This work provides extra insights into the photodynamics of the spectral jumps on defect-based single-photon emitters hosted in wide-bandgap semiconductors.
